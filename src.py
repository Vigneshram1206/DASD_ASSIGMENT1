## this must be implemented in OOP, I am thinking to create one class for student record and one class for hashtable


#Design a hash function HashId() which accepts the applicant’s name as a parameter and returns the hash value
def HashId(stname):
    #to mimic the functionality intitally planning to with 
    #python dictionaries slowly remove them later once the project is executing
    pass

#This function creates an empty hash table and points to null
def initializeHash(self):
    # I suppose the project must be planned in OOPS
    pass

#This function inserts the student’s name and corresponding details into the hash table
def insertAppDetails(ApplicationRecords, name, phone, country, program, status): 
    pass

#This function finds the applicant’s details based on the name and updates the corresponding details into the hash table.
def updateAppDetails(ApplicationRecords, name, phone, country, program, status):
    pass

#This function prints the list of all applicants who have applied to a particular program
def memRef(ApplicationRecords, Program):
    pass

#This function prints the list of number of applications in their current stage 
# - of the application process including Applied, Rejected and Approved
def appStatus(ApplicationRecords):
    pass

#This function destroys all the entries inside hash table. This is a clean-up code.
def destroyHash(ApplicationRecords):
    pass
